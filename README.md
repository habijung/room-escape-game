# Project Abstract

We thought making a game is a good project to apply knowledge that we have learned through this semester. Thus, we made a simple room escape game with first person viewpoint. Various technique such as VBO, texture, and lighting are used in this game. To clear the game, a player should answer the correct numbers which are hidden in the objects. Since we made a special selection view mode when a player clicks the objects, the player can observe the objects in detail. Thus, the player has to explore the room and examine the objects.
